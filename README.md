# ALX Listing App

## Description

This is a simple booking management system derived from the AirBnB system, designed to meet usability needs, ease of use, and flexibility. It features a reusable component-based structure for creating dynamic and scalable web applications.

## Project Structure

- **components/common/**: Contains reusable UI components (e.g., `Card`, `Button`).
- **interfaces/**: Defines TypeScript interfaces for props and data structures.
- **constants/**: Stores reusable constants (e.g., API URLs, default images).
- **public/assets/**: Contains static assets like images and SVG files.

---

## Project Goals

- Develop a functional and aesthetically pleasing booking management system.
- Provide a seamless user experience with an intuitive UI design.
- Implement robust backend functionality for managing property listings, bookings, and users.

## Setup instructions

First, run the development server:

```bash
clone the repository with  `git clone https://github.com/AckimJnr/alx-listing-app.git`
cd alx-listing-app
npm install (to install project dependencies)
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes) instead of React pages.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
